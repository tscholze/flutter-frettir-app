# Frettir

> A customizeable Wordpress Feed Reader writting as a Beginner project for Google Flutter and Dart.

## Idea behind
It is never to late to learn something new. 
Thats why I want to learn the new Flutter framework and Dart. As a trick to stay focused during the learning nights, I like to create example projects that could be used as a 'trainings area'. I test primarily on iOS.
